                      <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
         <p>Gemsbok are widely hunted for their spectacular horns that average 85 cm (33 in) in length. From a distance, the only outward difference between males and females is their horns, and many hunters mistake females for males each year. In males horns tend to be thicker with larger bases. Females have slightly longer, thinner horns.</p>
         <p>Female gemsbok use their horns to defend themselves and their offspring from predators, while males primarily use their horns to defend their territories from other males.Gemsbok are one of the few antelope species where female trophies are sometimes more desirable than male ones. A gemsbok horn can be fashioned into a natural trumpet and, according to some authorities, can be used as a shofar. </p>   
                          
                          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
         <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
