                      <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <P> Giraffes are usually found in groups that vary in size and composition according to ecological, anthropogenic, temporal, and social factors.Traditionally, the composition of these groups had been described as open and ever-changing.For research purposes, a "group" has been defined as "a collection of individuals that are less than a kilometre apart and moving in the same general direction". More recent studies have found that giraffes have long-term social associations and may form groups or pairs based on kinship, sex or other factors, and these groups regularly associate with one another in larger communities or sub-communities within a fissionâ€“fusion society. Proximity to humans can disrupt social arrangements. Masai giraffes of Tanzania live in distinct social subpopulations that overlap spatially, but have different reproductive rates and calf survival rates.</P>
                <p> The number of giraffes in a group can range from one up to 66 individuals. Giraffe groups tend to be sex-segregated although mixed-sex groups made of adult females and young males also occur.Female groups may be matrilineally related. Generally females are more selective than males in who they associate with regarding individuals of the same sex.Particularly stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months.Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older, males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups.Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges that vary according to rainfall and proximity to human settlements.Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.</p>
                <p>Early biologists suggested giraffes were mute and unable to produce air flow of sufficient velocity to vibrate their vocal folds.To the contrary; they have been recorded to communicate using snorts, sneezes, coughs, snores, hisses, bursts, moans, grunts, growls and flute-like sounds.During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds.Snorting and hissing in adults is associated with vigilance.During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range. The purpose is unclear.Dominant males display to other males with an erect posture; holding the chin and head high while walking stiffly and approaching them laterally. The less dominant show submissiveness by lowing the head and ears with the chin moved in and then jump and flee.</p>
